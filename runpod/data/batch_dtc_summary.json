        "original_context": "### Technical Description\nMass Air Flow (MAF) Circuit Range/Performance\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (Nissan, Chevrolet, GMC, Mercedes, VW, Toyota, Mazda, BMW, Ford, Audi, Honda, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\nThe MAF (mass air flow) sensor is a sensor mounted in a vehicle's engine air intake tract downstream from the air filter, and is used to measure the volume and density of air being drawn into the engine. The MAF sensor itself only measures a  portion of the air entering and that value is used to calculate the total volume and density of air being ingested.\nThe powertrain control module (PCM) uses that reading along with other sensor parameters to ensure proper fuel delivery at any given time for optimum power and fuel efficiency.\nBasically this P0101 diagnostic trouble code (DTC) means that there is a problem with the Mass Air Flow (MAF)\n  sensor or circuit. The PCM detects that the actual MAF sensor frequency signal\n  is not within a predetermined expected range of the calculated MAF value.\nNote: Some MAF sensors also incorporate an air temperature sensor, which is another value used by the PCM for optimal engine operation.\nClosely related MAF circuit trouble codes include:\nP0100Mass or Volume Air Flow \"A\" Circuit MalfunctionP0102Mass \n    or Volume Air Flow \"A\" Circuit Low InputP0103Mass \n    or Volume Air Flow \"A\" Circuit High InputP0104Mass or Volume Air Flow \"A\" Circuit Intermittent\nPhoto of a MAF sensor:\n\n### Symptoms\nSymptoms of a P0101 code may include:\nMalfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illumination (a.k.a. check engine light)Rough running engineBlack smoke from tail pipeStallingEngine hard start or stalling after it startsPossible other driveability symptoms\n\n### Possible Causes\nPotential causes for this trouble code may include:\nDirty or contaminated mass air flow sensorFailed MAF sensorIntake air leaksMAF sensor electrical harness or wiring problem (open, shorted, frayed, poor connection, etc.)Clogged catalytic converter on some models (GMC/Chevrolet mainly)\nNote that other codes may be present if you have a P0101. You may have misfire codes or O2 sensor codes, so it's important to take a \"big picture\" look at how the systems work together and effect each other when doing a diagnosis.\n\n### Diagnostic Steps & Possible Solutions\nPossible diagnostic and repair steps include:\nVisually inspect all MAF sensor wiring and connectors to make sure they are intact, not frayed, broken, routed too close to ignition wires/coils, relays, motors, etc.Visually inspect for any obvious air leaks in the air intake systemVisually *closely* inspect the MAF sensor wires or film to see if you can see contamination such as dirt, dust, oil, etc.If the air filter is dirty, replace itCarefully clean the MAF usingMAF cleaner sprayis generally a good DIY friendly diagnostic/repair stepIf the air intake system has a mesh in it, make sure that is also clean (VWs mainly)Loss of vacuum to the MAP sensor can trigger this DTCA low minimum air rate through the sensor bore may cause this DTC to set\n      at idle or during deceleration. Inspect for any vacuum leaks downstream\n  of the MAF sensor.Use a scan tool to monitor real-time sensor values from the MAF sensor, O2 sensors, etc.Check for Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) for your particular make/model in case of known issues on your vehicleThe barometric pressure (BARO) that is used in order to calculate the predicted \n    MAF value is initially based on theMAP sensorat key ON.A high resistance on the ground circuit of theMAP \n    sensorcan cause this DTC to setDo an exhaust backpressure test to determine if the catalytic converter may be clogged\nIf you do need to replace the MAF sensor, we recommend using an original equipment OEM one from the manufacturer rather than buying an aftermarket part.\nNote: The use of a reusable oiled air filter could be a cause of this code, if it is over-oiled. Oil can transfer to the fine wire or film inside the MAF sensor and contaminate it. Use something such asMAF cleaner sprayto clean the MAF in such situations.\n\n### P0101 MAF Sensor Repair Video\nThis video is not produced by us, it is here as an aid in resolving your P0101 trouble code (DTC).\n\n### Related  DTC Discussions\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n2002 silverado 1500 4x4 5.3 l engine codes p0101 p0300i have a 02 chevy silverado 5.3 liter 83000 mile replaced maf sensor o2 sensors before cat still getting p0101 and p0300 codes can anyone help me...2003 silhouette 3.4l P0101 125,000 milesVehicle stalls and is very hard to start.

        "original_context": "### Technical Description\nSystem Too Lean (Bank 1)\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model. So this engine code article applies to Toyota, Chevrolet, Ford, Nissan, Honda, GMC, Dodge, etc.\nBasically this means that an oxygen sensor in bank 1 has detected a lean condition \n  (too much oxygen in the exhaust). On V6/V8/V10 engines, Bank 1 is the side of \n  the engine that has cylinder #1. The P0171 is one of the more common trouble codes.\nThis code is triggered by the first downstream (front) O2 sensor. The sensor provides a reading of the air:fuel ratio leaving the engine's cylinders, and the vehicles powertrain/engine control module (PCM/ECM) uses that reading and adjusts to keep the engine running at that optimum ratio of  14.7:1. If something is not right and the PCM cannot maintain the 14.7:1 ratio, but rather there is too much air, it triggers this code.\nYou'll want to also read our article onshort and long term fuel trimsto help understand the operation of the engine. Note: This DTC is very similar toP0174, and in fact \n  your vehicle may show both codes at the same time.\n\n### Symptoms\nYou will more than likely not notice any drivability problems, although there \n  may be symptoms such as:\na lack of powerdetonation (spark knock)rough idlehesitation/surge on acceleration.\n\n### Causes\nA codeP0171may mean that one or more of the following \n  has happened:\nThe MAF (Mass Air Flow) Sensor is dirty or faultyNote: The use of \"oiled\" \n    air filters may cause the MAF to become dirty if the filter is over-oiled. \n    There is also an issue with some vehicles where the MAF sensors leak the silicone \n    potting material used to protect the circuitry.There could be a vacuum leak downstream of the MAF sensorPossible cracked vacuum or PCV line/connectionFaulty or stuck open PCV valveFailed or faulty oxygen sensor (bank 1, sensor 1)Sticking/plugged or failed fuel injectorLow fuel pressure (possible plugged/dirty fuel filter!)Exhaust leak between engine and first oxygen sensor\n\n### Possible Solutions\nA lot of times, cleaning the MAF sensor and finding/fixing vacuum leaks fix the problem. If you're on a tight budget, start there, but that may not be the fix for certain. So, possible solutions include:\nClean the MAF sensor. \n    Consult your service manual for it's location if you need help. I find it's \n    best to take it off and spray it with electronics cleaner or brake cleaner. \n    Make sure you are careful not to damage the MAF sensor, and make sure it's \n    dry before reinstallingInspect all vacuum and PCV hoses, replace/repair as requiredInspect all hoses and connections in the air intake systemInspect and/or test the intake manifold gaskets for leakageCheck for a dirty fuel filter and proper fuel pressureIdeally you'll want to monitor short and long term fuel trims using an advanced scan toolIf you have access, you may want to run a smoke test\n\n### Related  DTC Discussions\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n1999 Chevy Silverado Codes P0327, P0171, and P0174Okay guys I'm back with the same problem.

        "original_context": "### Technical Description\nSystem Too Lean (Bank 2)\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Brands of vehicles affected include but are not limited to Ford, Lexus, Chevy, BMW, Toyota, Jaguar, Acura, Volvo, Nissan, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model/engine. Anecdotally this code seems more common in Ford & Chevy vehicles.\nEvery vehicle has a PCM or ECM (powertrain / engine control module). It's basically the \"brain\" or main computer of the vehicle, it's job is to monitor a variety of sensor readings and use that information to run the engine in the most efficient operation given the current conditions.\nBasically this P0174 code means that the upstream oxygen sensor in bank 2 reporting a lean condition \n(too much oxygen in the exhaust). On V6/V8/V10/V12 engines, Bank 2 is the side of the engine that doesn't have cylinder #1.\nThe engine uses what are called O2 or oxygen sensors in the exhaust stream to determine the air to fuel ratio of the exhaust leaving the engine. The PCM (or ECM) uses that information to determine how much fuel to inject via the fuel injectors many times per second. The ideal air:fuel ratio is 14.7:1. The PCM can adjust the amount of fuel by adding more fuel or taking away fuel to keep the engine operating efficiently and with low emissions.\nIf an O2 sensor is telling the PCM through it's reading that the exhaust has too much air in it, the PCM compensates by adding more fuel. In this case it's adding more fuel to bank 2. The PCM will only adjust up to a certain point to the amount of fuel that it will inject in an attempt to bring that air:fuel ratio as close to optimal as possible. When the PCM has reached it's limit on how much fuel it will inject but the front (upstream) bank 2 oxygen sensor still detects a lean condition, the PCM will continue to command a higher than normal amount of fuel to bank 2 and will trigger this code and illuminate the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp).\nP0174 code shown on scanner:\nSo there's an interesting point to be made now, though. This code could be set because the PCM thinks it's sending more fuel to bank 2 injectors but in reality they're not actually putting out more fuel. So in other words this code could be set due to a fueling problem. Additional possible causes for this code are listed a little further down in this article.\nNote: This DTC is very similar toP0171which is a lean code for bank 1, and in fact \n  your vehicle may show both codes at the same time. In the case of some Ford's (e.g. 4.6L or 5.4L V8's) it's common to see P0171 and P0174 at the same time.\n\n### Symptoms\nYou will more than likely not notice any drivability problems as a result of a P0174, although there \n  may be symptoms such as:\nlack of powerincreased fuel consumptiondetonation (spark knock)hesitation/surge on acceleration\n\n### Causes\nA code P0174 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:\nThe MAF (Mass Air Flow) Sensor is dirty or faulty (if equipped). Note: The use of \"oiled\" \n    air filters can cause the MAF to become contaminated if the filter is over-oiled. \n    There is also an issue with some vehicles where the MAF sensors leak the silicone \n    potting material used to protect the circuitry.There could be a vacuum leak downstream of the MAF sensorFuel problem (rail/injectors/pump/regulator)\n\n### Possible Solutions\nIf you find yourself with this code, do not just assume the O2 oxygen sensor is bad and replace it first! Please do proper diagnosis before even buying parts. Proper step-by-step diagnosis will save you money in the long run, and you'll generally learn new things.\nWe can't give vehicle specific repair steps because it can vary depending on the year, make, model, and engine of your particular vehicle. We do, however provide some general diagnostic information that will hopefully help you solve your P0174 lean code.\nPossible solutions include:\nIn many cases, simply cleaning the MAF sensor does the trick. \n    Consult your service manual for it's location if you need help.

Consult a reliable vehicle information source for the location of the number 2 cylinder for the vehicle in question.This type of code may be caused by a fuel delivery problem, a large vacuum leak, an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) malfunction, or mechanical engine failure, but is most often the result of an ignition system defect resulting in a low or no spark condition.Virtually all OBD II equipped vehicles use a distributor-less, coil-over-plug (COP), high-intensity spark, ignition system. It is controlled by the PCM to effect precise ignition spark and timing.The PCM calculates input signals from the crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, and throttle position sensor (among others depending upon the vehicle) to configure an ignition spark timing strategy.In a realistic sense, the camshaft position sensor and crankshaft position sensor are vital to operation of the OBD II ignition system. Using input signals from these sensors, the PCM delivers a voltage signal that causes the high-intensity ignition coils (usually one for each cylinder) to fire in sequential order.Since the crankshaft turns at a speed that is approximately twice as fast as the camshaft(s), it is crucial that the PCM knows their exact position; both overall and in relation to one another. A simple method of explaining this aspect of engine operation is this:Top dead center (TDC) is the point where the crankshaft and camshaft(s) align with the piston (for the number one cylinder) at its highest point and the intake valve(s) (for cylinder number one) opened. This is known as the compression stroke.During the compression stroke, air and fuel are drawn into the combustion chamber. At this point, an ignition spark is required to cause combustion. The PCM recognizes the position of the crankshaft and camshaft and initiates the voltage signal required to result in a high-intensity spark from the ignition coil.Combustion in the cylinder propels the piston back in a downward fashion. As the engine rolls through the compression stroke, and the number one piston begins to withdraw towards the crankshaft, the intake valve(s) is closed. This begins the exhaust stroke. As the crankshaft completes another revolution, the number one piston once again reaches its highest point. Since the camshaft(s) has only completed a half revolution, the intake valve remains closed and the exhaust valve is opened. At the top of the exhaust stroke, no ignition spark is required, as this stroke is used to push spent exhaust gases out of the cylinder, through the opening created by the open exhaust valve(s), and into the exhaust manifold.Typical high-intensity ignition coil operation is accomplished with a constant supply of fused, switched (only present with the ignition switch placed in the ON position) battery voltage and a ground pulse supplied (at the appropriate instant) by the PCM. When the ground pulse is applied to the ignition coil (primary) circuit, the coil emits a high-intensity spark (up to 50,000-volts) for a fraction of a second. This high-intensity spark is transferred through a spark plug wire or boot and a spark plug, which is threaded into the cylinder head or intake manifold, where it makes contact with a precise air/fuel mixture. The result is a controlled explosion. If this explosion fails to occur, the engine RPM level is affected and the PCM detects it. After that, the PCM monitors camshaft position, crankshaft position, and individual coil feedback voltage inputs to determine which cylinder has misfired or is currently misfiring.If the cylinder misfire is not consistent or severe enough, the code may appear as pending and the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may only flash when the PCM actually detects a misfire (then go off when it does not). The system is designed in this fashion to alert the driver that an engine misfire of this degree can be harmful to the catalytic converter and other engine components. Once the misfire becomes more consistent and severe, a P0302 will be stored and constant MIL illumination will occur.Code SeverityConditions which promote storage of a P0302 are likely to cause catalytic converter and/or engine damage. This code should be classified as severe.Code SymptomsSymptoms of a P0302 may include:Diminished engine pe",

        "original_context": "### Technical Description\nCatalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model. So this engine code article applies to Nissan, Toyota, Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, GMC, Subaru, VW, etc.\nP0420 is one of the more common trouble codes that we see. Other popular codes includeP0171,P0300,P0455,P0442, etc. So be sure to bookmark this site for future reference!\nThe catalytic converter is a part of the exhaust system that looks kind of like a muffler, although it's job is very different from that of a muffler. A catalytic converter's job is to reduce emissions from the exhaust.\nThe catalytic converter has an oxygen sensor in front and behind it. When the vehicle is warm and running in closed loop mode, the upstream oxygen sensor waveform reading should fluctuate. The downstream O2 sensor reading should be fairly steady. Typically theP0420code triggers the Check Engine Light if the readings of the two sensors are similar. Oxygen sensors are also referred to as O2 sensors.\nThis is indicative of (among other things) a converter that is not working as efficiently as it should be (according to specs). Catalytic converters are not normally a \"wear\" type item, that is they are not designed to wear out and need replacement. If they have failed, it is likely due to something else that caused it to fail. This is what a P0420 means in simplified terms.\n\n### Symptoms\nThe main symptom to the driver is the illumination of the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp). You will likely not notice any drivability problems, although there may be \n  symptoms. For example, if the substance inside the catalytic converter is broken or failed, it may be restricting the exhaust which will result in a feeling of reduced power output from the vehicle.\n\n### Causes\nA codeP0420may mean that one or more of the following \n  has happened:\nLeaded fuel was used where unleaded was called for (unlikely)A damaged or failed oxygen / O2 sensorDownstream oxygen sensor (HO2S) wiring damaged or connected improperlyThe engine coolant temperature sensor is not working properlyDamaged or leaking exhaust manifold / catalytic converter / muffler / exhaust pipeFailed or underperforming catalytic converter (likely)Retarded spark timingThe oxygen sensors in front and behind the converter are reporting too similar \n    of readingsLeaking fuel injector or high fuel pressureCylinder misfireOil contamination\n\n### Possible Solutions\nSome suggested steps for troubleshooting and fixing aP0420error \n  code include:\nCheck for exhaust leaks at the manifold, pipes, catalytic converter. Repair \n    as required.Use a scope to diagnose the oxygen sensor operation (Tip: The oxygen sensor \n    in front of the catalytic converter normally has a fluctuating waveform. The \n    waveform of the sensor behind the converter should be more steady).Inspect the downstream heated oxygen sensor, replace if necessaryReplace the catalytic converter\nGenerally speaking you can look at the temperature of the exhaust just before and just after the converter using an infrared temperature gun. The output should be about 100 degrees Fahrenheit hotter when the engine is fully warmed up.\nOverall probably the biggest mistake vehicles owners make when they have a P0420 code is to simply replace an oxygen sensor (02 sensor). It is important to do proper diagnosis so you're not wasting money replacing parts unnecessarily.\nWe strongly recommend that if you need to replace the catalytic converter that you replace it with an original manufacturer brand unit (i.e. get it from a dealership). Second choice would be a high-quality replacement part such as a 50-state legal cat. There are many stories in our forums where folks replaced the cat with a cheaper aftermarket one only to have the code return shortly thereafter.\nOne thing to note is that many vehicle manufacturers offer a longer warranty \n  on emissions-related parts. So if you have a newer car but it's out of it's \n  bumper-to-bumper warranty, there still may be warranty on this type of problem. \n  Many manufacturers give a five year, unlimited mileage warranty on these items. \n  It's worth checking into.\nSee also:P0420.com- P0420 Help\n\n### Related  DTC Discussions\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n1996 gmc safari p0420 p0300 po131 p0151 p0172 decel misfireI've replaced the EGR valve, all 4 O2 sensors, plugs, wires, cap&rotorX3.

Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\nThe powertrain control module (PCM) monitors the temperature of the air entering \n  the engine. The PCM supplies a 5 volt reference voltage to the Intake Air Temperature \n  (IAT) sensor\nThe IAT is a thermistor that varies resistance based on temperature. \n  As the temperature increases, resistance decreases. Low temperature results \n  in a high signal voltage. When the PCM sees a signal voltage higher than 5 volts, \n  it sets this P0113 check engine light code.Potential SymptomsThere will likely be no symptoms other than illumination of the Malfunction \n  Indicator Lamp (MIL - Check Engine Light / Service Engine Soon).CausesA code P0113 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:Internally failed IAT sensorFaulty connection at IAT sensorOpen in IAT ground circuit or signal circuitShort to voltage in IAT signal circuit or reference circuitIAT harness and/or wiring routed too close to high-voltage wiring (e.g. \n    alternator, spark plug cables, etc.)Faulty PCM (less likely but not impossible)Possible SolutionsFirst, if you have access to a scan tool, is there an IAT reading? If the IAT \n  reading is logical then the problem is likely intermittent. If the reading is \n  less than -30 degrees, unplug the connector. Install a jumper wire between the \n  harness connector signal and ground circuits. The IAT temperature reading on \n  the scan tool should be maxed out at the high end. For example it should be \n  280 degrees Farenheit or higher. If it is, the wiring is okay, and it may have \n  been the connection. If it isn't install the jumper wire between the IAT signal \n  circuit and the chassis ground.If now the IAT reading on the scan tool is maxed \n  out then check for an open in the IAT ground circuit. If you get no reading \n  at all on the scan tool, it's likely that the sensor signal is open or the 5 \n  volt reference is missing. Check using a DVOM (digital volt ohm meter) for a \n  5 volt reference. If it's there, then unplug the connector at the PCM and check \n  for continuity on the IAT signal circuit between the PCM connector and the IAT \n  connector.Other IAT sensor and circuit related DTCs:P0095,P0096,P0097,P0098,P0099,P0110,P0111,P0112,P0114,P0127Related  DTC DiscussionsRegister now to ask a question (free)Four codes (P0102, P0113, P0303, P0316 ), where to start?Hi to all,\nYesterday I scanned my wife's 2003 Mustang and go 4 codes: P0102, P0113, P0303 and P0316. \nWhere to start?

        "original_context": "### OBD-II Trouble Code Technical Description\nEngine Coolant Temperature Sensor Circuit High Input\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to all 1996-newer vehicles (Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen VW, Mazda, Dodge, Ford, BW, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\nTheengine coolant temperature (ECT) sensoris a thermistor screwed into a \n  coolant passage in the cylinder head. Sensor resistance is high when coolant \n  temperature is low and resistance drops when coolant temperature increases.\nThe powertrain control module (PCM) provides a 5 volt reference and a ground \n  to the sensor. The PCM monitors voltage drop to determine coolant temperature. \n  If the ECT reads less than freezing temp. when engine has been running for more \n  than a few minutes, the PCM determines a circuit fault and sets this code. Or \n  if the PCM determines the sensor resistance is out of specs, this code is set.An example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensorPotential SymptomsSymptoms of a P0118 could include:Very poor fuel economyA no start conditionVehicle may start, but run very poorly, blowing black smoke, running very \n    rough and misfiringIllumination of MILCausesA code P0118 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:A bad connection at the sensorAn open in the ground circuit between theECT sensorand the PCMA short in the voltage feed between the sensor and the PCMA bad PCM (less likely)A bad temperature sensor (shorted internally)Possible SolutionsFirst, if you have access to a scan tool, check the reading of thecoolant \n  sensor. Does it read a logical number? If so, the problem is likely intermittent. \n  Perform a \"wiggle\" test by wiggling the connector and harness to the \n  sensor while watching the reading on the scan tool. Watch for any drop-outs. \n  Drop-outs would indicate a bad connection. If the scan tool reads an illogical \n  temperature, check the resistance of the temperature sensor. If it is out of \n  specs, replace it. If it is in specifications, unplug the sensor and, using \n  a fused jumper wire, jumper the two terminals of the connector together. The \n  temperature reading should now be maxed out to above 250 degrees F. If not, \n  there is likely a problem with the ground circuit or voltage supply.Check for 5 volts reference voltage at the connector. Also check for ground \n  presence at the connector. If you do not have 5V ref. and/or ground continuity, \n  check for these back at the PCM connector. If you have these at the PCM connector, \n  then repair open or short between the PCM and the sensor. If you do not, remove \n  the offending wire from the PCM and then check for proper voltage at the PCM \n  pin. If it's present now, repair short on the circuit. If it isn't present after \n  removing the wire and checking the pin, replace PCMNOTE: Usually, P0118 is indicative of a bad temperature sensor, but doesn't \n  rule out these other possibilities. If you're unsure of how to diagnose a PCM, \n  do not attempt.Other engine coolant  engine light codes:P0115,P0116,P0117,P0118,P0119,P0125,P0128Related  DTC DiscussionsRegister now to ask a question (free)code p0118  2009 malibuhello everyone new guy here with a problem that's driving me nuts. my 09 malibu 2.4 temp gauge went to zero and cooling fans were running constantly. although car was not overheating and running fine, i changed ect sensor and thermostat. car ran fine  for about 2 weeks. same thing happened so i thou...97 Camaro V6 Error codes P0123 P0118 P1406I own a 97 Camaro V6 3800 series 2 automatic transmission.

Brands of vehicles that may see this code include but are not limited to Pontiac, Toyota, Mazda, Dodge, Chevrolet, Honda, Jeep, Ford, VW, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\nThis means that the engine's powertrain control module (PCM) has detected that the engine has not reached the \n  required temperature level within a specified amount of time after starting \n  the engine. Often, the intent of the P0128 code is to indicate a faulty thermostat (likely stuck in the open condition). \n  Similar codes:P0125\nIn determining that the engine did not reach a \"normal\" temperature, it \n  takes into account the length of time the vehicle has been running, the intake \n  air temperature (IAT) sensor reading, the engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor \n  reading, and the speed of the vehicle.\n\n### Symptoms\nYou will likely not notice any drivability problems other than theMILillumination. In some cases you may experience symptoms such as:\nEngine takes longer to warm upEngine temperature drops while driving at higher speeds\nA photo of a typical thermostat:\n\n### Causes\nA code P0128 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:\nLow engine coolant levelLeaking or stuck open thermostat (likely)Faulty cooling fan (running too much)Faultycoolant temperature (ECT) sensorFaulty intake air temperature (IAT) sensor\n\n### Possible Solutions\nNote: Please be sure the engine is turned off and cool when doing work on the cooling system. When the engine is warm, the cooling system is pressurized and very hot and can cause burns or other personal injuries if you are not careful.\nPast experience indicates that the most likely solution for a P0128 is to replace the thermostat. \n  However here are some suggestions on troubleshooting and repairing a P0128 OBD-II \n  code:\nVerify coolant strength & levelVerify proper cooling fan operation (check if it's running more than it \n    should). Replace if necessary.Verify proper engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor operation, replace \n    if necessary.Verify proper intake air temperature (IAT) sensor operation, replace if \n    necessary.If the above items check out good, replace the thermostatIf Nissan vehicle, check for Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs), as the ECM may need to be reprogrammed to correct the P0128 code\nRegardless of what vehicle year, make and model, it is advisable to check for TSBs because if there is a known fix set out by the automaker, it can save you time and money in the diagnosis and repair.\nAn example of the importance of checking for TSBs or technical service bulletins, is if you have aHonda Accord, bulletin #01-164may apply to you.

        "original_context": "### OBD-II Trouble Code Technical Description\nArticle byDon BowmanASE Certified Automotive Tech\nTurbocharger / Supercharger \"A\" Overboost Condition\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model.\nTrouble code P0234 indicates the powertrain control module (PCM) senses a dangerously high boost pressure from the engine's forced induction system. Levels of boost in excess of recommended levels can compromise the structural integrity of the engine.\nNormally, an engine relies on the vacuum produced by the downward movement of the piston to draw the air and fuel charge into the engine. A supercharger or turbocharger is an air compressor used to increase the air and fuel charge entering the engine. This is known as \"forced induction\" which allows a much smaller fuel-efficient engine to create the power normally available with a much larger engine.The mechanical apparatus used in forced induction is divided into three categories, positive displacement (roots style), centrifugal and turbo. The roots style and centrifugal chargers are belt driven while the turbo relies on pressure from the exhaust to operate.A roots or positive displacement supercharger is positioned on the top of the intake. A centrifugal looks much like a rotary air conditioning compressor and is located on the driver's side front of the engine. Turbochargers are located in line with the exhaust system.As boost pressure rises, the stress on the engine increases as well. Your engine has recommended boost pressure limits to preclude the possibility of engine component failure. Code P0234 is set when these limits are breached and should be corrected as soon as possible to prevent engine or transmission damage.Turbo chargers rely on exhaust pressure to spin the turbine blades fast enough to produce air pressure greater than atmospheric. However they have an inherent lag where the exhaust pressure is insufficient to spin the turbo fast enough to create pressure. Depending on the type of unit used, the turbo needs 1700 to 2500 engine rpm before it begins to \"spool up.\"Turbos spin around 250,000 rpm in full boost. Boost pressure increases with engine rpm. To regulate the boost pressure and prevent overboost, a wastegate valve is installed. Most modern turbos have an internal wastegate and external actuator. There is a rod from the actuator to the wastegate on the turbo. Intake manifold air pressure passes to the top of the wastegate. As boost pressure increases it begins to exert force on the spring in the actuator that holds the wastegate valve closed. The higher the pressure rises, the more it overpowers the spring, resulting in the wastegate opening and directing exhaust gas away from the turbo blades and preventing further increase in boost.Regulation of the pressure applied to the wastegate regulates the boost levels at specific rpm. To accomplish this, the computer uses barometric or MAP sensors, engine and transmission temperature sensors, knock sensors and intake pressure sensors to determine the amount of wastegate opening necessary to deliver the best boost levels.To regulate boost levels, the computer uses either a solenoid, stepper motor or pulse modulator. By regulating the pressure to the wastegate actuator, varying degrees of boost are possible.SymptomsThe symptoms displayed for a P0234 code will depend on the cause of the overboost condition:The service engine soon or check engine light will illuminate.You will experience a loss of power.The engine may show signs of overheating.The transmission may show signs of overheating and harsh shifting.Additional codes associated with the condition set by P0234 may be present to help identify the cause. Codes are available for all electrical components utilized by the engine management computer for the control of boost levels.The engine may display signs of pre-ignition in the form of knocking.The engine may display ignition misfiring.CausesPotential causes for this DTC include:In lieu of further trouble codes associated with the overboost condition it would be safe to say the problem is mechanical. The operation of the wastegate is the most probable.The wastegate is either stuck closed causing the turbo to spin higher than normal, thus causing the overboost.The rod from the wastegate actuator to the wastegate on the turbo is bent.A hose came off the wastegate or boost controller.A supply house to the boost controller or from the controller to the wastegate is clogged.Dodge trucks with a Cummins dieselhave a peculiar problem. They run fine but the check engine light comes on and sets code P0234 at an idle, yet the light goes out several minutes later at cruise speeds.

        "original_context": "### OBD-II Trouble Code Technical Description\nTurbocharger/Supercharger A Underboost Condition\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have a turbocharger or supercharger. Brands of vehicles affected may include but are not limited to Ford, GMC, Chevy, VW, Audi, Dodge, Hyundai, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ram, Fiat, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\nThe P0299 DTC code refers to a condition where the PCM/ECM (powertrain/engine control module) has detected that the bank \"A\" or single turbocharger or supercharger is not providing a normal amount of boost (pressure).\nThat could be due to a variety of reasons, which we detail below. On a normally operating turbocharged or supercharged engine the air going into the engine is pressurized and that's part of what makes so much power for an engine of it's size. If this code is set, you will likely notice reduced power output. Turbochargers are driven from the exhaust exiting the engine to use a turbine to force air into the intake. Superchargers are mounted on the intake side of the engine and are typically belt driven to force more air into the intake, with no connection to the exhaust.\nIn the case of Ford vehicles, this may apply: \"The PCM checks for a minimum throttle intake pressure (TIP) PID reading during engine operation, which indicates an underboost condition. This DTC sets when the PCM detects that the actual throttle intake pressure is less than the desired throttle intake pressure by 4 psi or more for 5 seconds.\"\nIn the case of VW & Audi vehicles, the code definition is slightly different, it is \"Boost Pressure Regulation: Control Range Not Reached.\" As you can probably tell that's basically just another way of stating an underboost condition.\nA typical turbocharger and related components:\n\n### Severity\nThe severity of this code can vary from moderate to severe. If you delay  repair of this issue, you can potentially experience more extensive and costly damage.\n\n### Symptoms\nSymptoms of a P0299 DTC may include:\nMIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illuminationReduced power output from engine, possibly in a \"limp\" modeUnusual sounds from the engine/turbo\nThere would likely be no other symptoms.\n\n### Potential Causes\nPotential causes of a P0299 turbo underboost code include:\nIntake (induction) air restriction or leakFailed or damaged turbocharger (sticking, binding, etc.)Faulty boost/charge pressure sensorFaulty wastegate bypass regulator valve (VW)Low fuel pressure condition (Isuzu)Sticking turbo nozzle control solenoid (Isuzu)Faulty injector control pressure (ICP) sensor (Ford)Low oil pressure (Ford)EGR system fault (Ford)Variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) actuator (Ford)VGT vanes sticking (Ford)\n\n### Possible P0299 Solutions\nFirst off, you'll want to repair any other DTC codes if present prior to diagnosing this code. You will next want to search for Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) that may apply to your year/make/model/engine configuration. TSBs are bulletins put out by the auto manufacturer to provide information on known issues, commonly surround specific trouble codes like this. If there is a known TSB you should start with that diagnosis as it can save you time and money.\nStart with a visual inspection. Inspect the intake air system for cracks, loose or disconnected hoses, restrictions, blockages, etc. Repair or replace as required.\nCheck the turbocharger wastegate regulating valve solenoid for correct operation.\nIf the air induction system tests OK, then you'll want to focus your diagnosis efforts on the charge pressure control, diverter valve (blowoff valve), sensors, regulators, etc. Really at this point you'll want to refer to a vehicle specific detailed repair manual for specific troubleshooting steps. There are some known issues on certain makes and engines so also check out our car repair forums here and search using your keywords. For example, if you search around, you'll find that a common fix for a P0299 in VWs is to replace or repair the diverter valve or wastegate solenoid. On the GM Duramax diesel, this code may mean the turbo housing resonator has failed. If you have a Ford, you'll want to next check the wastegate regulating valve solenoid for correct operation.\nAnecdotally in Fords, this seems to be found in EcoBoost or Powerstroke engine equipped vehicles such as F150, Explorer, Edge, F250/F350, and Escape. Regarding VW & Audi models, that may include A4, Tiguan, Golf, A5, Passat, GTI, Q5, and others. When it comes to Chevy and GMC it's mainly seen on the Cruze, Sonic, and Duramax equipped vehicles. The information in this article is slightly generic in the fact that each model may have it's own known fix for this code. Good luck with your repair!

Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\nThe crankshaft position sensor (CKP) measures crankshaft location and relays this information to the PCM (Powertrain Control Module).\nDepending on the vehicle, the PCM uses this crankshaft position information to time the spark properly or on some systems it is only for misfire detection and does not control spark timing.  The CKP sensor is stationary and works in harmony with a reluctor ring (or toothed ring) that is attached to the crankshaft.  As this reluctor ring passes in front of the CKP sensor, the magnetic field created by the CKP sensor is interrupted and this creates a square wave voltage signal that the PCM interprets as crankshaft position.  If the PCM detects that there are no crankshaft pulses or if it sees a problem with the pulses on the output circuit,P0335will set.\nRelated crank position sensor trouble codes:\nP0336Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Range/PerformanceP0337Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Low InputP0338Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit High InputP0339Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Intermittent\n\n### Symptoms\nNOTE:  If the crank sensor is used only for misfire detection and NOT spark timing (this varies with the vehicle), the vehicle should start and run with MIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination.

Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\nEGR stands for Exhaust Gas Recirculation. It is part of the vehicle emmissions \n  system, and is used to reduce combustion temperature and pressure to control \n  Oxides of Nitrogen. There are generally three parts to the EGR system: the EGR \n  valve, an actuator solenoid, and a differential pressure sensor EGR (DPFE). \n  These things work together to deliver the correct amount of recirculation based \n  on engine temperature, load, etc. The P0401 code means that OBD detected an \n  insufficient amount of EGR.\nSymptomsYou may notice drivability problems such as pinging (a.k.a. pre-ignition knock) when the engine is under load or the vehicle is at higher speeds. There may also be other symptoms.CausesA code P0401 most likely means one or more of the following has happened:The DPFE (differential pressure feedback EGR) sensor is faulty and needs \n    to be replacedThere is a blockage in the EGR (tube), most likely carbon buildupThe EGR valve is faultyThe EGR valve may not be opening due to a lack of vaccuumPossible SolutionsIn fixing this code, it is quite common for people to just replace the EGR valve only to have the OBD code return.

        "original_context": "### OBD-II Trouble Code Technical Description\nArticle byDale ToalstonASE Certified Technician\nIAC (Idle Air Control) System Malfunction\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\n\n### What does that mean?\nThe IAC (Idle Air Control) valve controls the idle speed of the engine. At idle the throttle plate is closed, of course. The IAC is computer controlled and allows only a certain amount of air around the throttle plate. This metered air controls the idle speed. The IAC has a \"plunger\" or \"shutter\" that moves to open or close the bypass air passageway.\nThe more air the IAC allows around the throttle plate, the higher the idle. The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) uses the IAC valve to keep the idle speed correct with varying engine demands. Can be a three or four wire sensor depending on the model.The PCM monitors voltages of the IAC circuits and if it detects an incorrect voltage on one or more of the IAC motor circuits it will set P0505. NOTE: Problems with the IAC would only be noticeable at idle or when throttle is closed.SymptomsSymptoms may include:MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illuminationEngine stalls and may not idle unless throttle is depressedIntermittently stalls when letting off the throttleEngine may idle too highCausesPotential causes of an P0505 code include:IAC motor connector is damaged (check connector and pins for damage, and moisture)One or more IAC circuits open or shorted to groundOne or more IAC circuits are shorted to voltageIAC has failedPCM has failedPossible SolutionsThis should be a fairly straightforward diagnosis. Start by clearing the fault codes. Then unplug the IAC and start the engine (This may cause other IAC codes to set. Just ignore them for now). If the P0505 code doesn't reset, replace the IAC. It is internally shorting one of the IAC circuits. If the code DOES return after unplugging the IAC and starting the engine, then you know it isn't the IAC motor. Visually check the wiring harness all the way back to the PCM. You may need to visually inspect the harness by removing all the insulation off the wires. It is possible that the wires could be shorting to eachother or to other wires in the harness.If there are no wiring problems, and the code keeps returning with the IAC unplugged, you can check the PCM by removing the IAC wires from the PCM connector (or clipping the wires in a location where they can be repaired easily) and then start the engine (If you're not sure, don't do it. Take it to a qualified professional). Now if the code doesn't reset there is a problem with the wiring. Check for continuity on all the IAC wires. Any resistance points to a problem. Check for voltage on any(At this point there shouldn't be any voltages on the wires because they're clipped at one end and unplugged at the IAC). Repair as necessary. But if the P0505 code DOES reset after removing the IAC wires from the PCM connector (or clipping them), replace the PCM, there's a problem internally on the IAC control circuit.Other related DTCs:P0506,P0507Related  DTC DiscussionsRegister now to ask a question (free)P0505 2001 MaximaHas anyone had this problem and did you discover that it was the Idle Air Control Valve or something else.

        "original_context": "### OBD-II Trouble Code Technical Description\nIdle Air Control System RPM Higher Than Expected\n\n### What does P0507 mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model. Acedotally this code seems to be more commonly found on Chevrolet, VW, Nissan, Audi, Hyundai, Honda, Mazda and Jeep vehicles.\nThis P0507 code is one that's sometimes triggered on vehicles that have electronic \n  throttle control. That is, they don't have a regular throttle cable from the \n  accelerator pedal to the engine. They rely on sensors and electronics to control \n  the throttle.\nIn this case, the P0507 DTC (diagnostic trouble code) is triggered \n  when the PCM (powertrain control module) detects an engine idle speed that is \n  greater than the desired (pre-programmed) RPM. In the case of GM vehicles (and \n  possibly others) if the idle speed is over 200 rpm higher than expected, this \n  code will be set.An example of an Idle Air Control (IAC) valve:Potential SymptomsMost likely you'll notice the idle speed is higher than normal. There are potentially \n  other symptoms as well. Of course, when trouble codes are set, the MIL (malfunction \n  indicator lamp, a.k.a. the check engine light) illuminates.CausesA P0507 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:A vacuum leakLeaking air intake after the throttle bodyEGR valve leaking vacuumA faulty positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valveDamaged/failed/dirty throttle bodyFailed EVAP systemFailed IAC (idle air controller) or faulty IAC circuitPossible SolutionsThis DTC is more of an informational code, so if there are any other codes \n  set, diagnose them first. If there are no other codes, inspect the intake air \n  system for air or vacuum leaks and damage. If there are no symptoms other than \n  the DTC itself, just clear the code and see whether it returns.If you have an advanced scan tool that can interact with the car, command the \n  idle higher and lower to see if the engine responds appropriately. Also check \n  the PCV valve to see if it's blocked and needs to be replaced. Check the IAC \n  (idle air controller) if equipped, verify it's operation.

The most common fix for a P0606 code is to replace the PCM, although in some cases re-flashing the PCM with updated software could possibly fix this. Be sure to check for TSB's on your vehicle (Technical Service Bulletins).In all likelyhood the fix is to replace the PCM. This is generally not a \"do-it-yourself\" task, although in some cases it may be. We strongly recommend you have a qualified repair shop / technician do the work, one that has the capability to reprogram the new PCM. Installing the new PCM may involve using special tools to program the vehicle's VIN (vehicle identification number) and/or anti-theft information (PATS, etc.).NOTE: This repair may be covered under the emissions warranty so be sure to check with your dealer as this may be covered beyond the bumper-to-bumper or powertrain warranty period.Other PCM DTC codes:P0600,P0601,P0602,P0603,P0604,P0605,P0607, P0608, P0609, P0610.Related  DTC DiscussionsRegister now to ask a question (free)2006 Lexus GS300 'P0606' with 'C1201' issues...Hi guys, I'm stuck with an issue that is happening to my 2006 Lexus GS300.

Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\n\n### What does that mean?\nMany vehicles have a control module for the automatic transmission called a transmission control module (TCM). The engine control module (ECM) communicates with the TCM to monitor the automatic transmission for faults. If the TCM detects a fault in the automatic transmission and sets a transmission related fault code, the ECM is informed of this also and sets a P0700 in the ECM memory.\nThis illuminates the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) to let the driver know there is a problem. If this code is present and the MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) is illuminated that basically means there is at least one transmission code set in the TCM's memory. P0700 is an informational code only. It doesn't point to a direct fault in the engine, only a general fault in the transmission. More diagnosis is necessary to identify what the transmission fault is. This requires a scan tool that will communicate with the transmission module.SymptomsSymptoms of a P0700 DTC may include:Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminationThe transmission may exhibit drivability problems like slipping, etc.CausesMore often then not, the cause of this code is that there is a transmission problem of some kind. The TCM detected the problem and set a code. P0700 means that a fault code is stored in the TCM. However this doesn't rule out the possibility of a failed PCM or TCM (unlikely).Possible SolutionsFor a P0700 the only real solution is to acquire a scan tool that will communicate with the transmission control module. Extracting this code from the TCM will be the first step in repairing the fault in the transmission.If the TCM compatible scan tool will not communicate with the Transmission Control Module then that is a good indication that there may be a fault with the TCM itself.Related  DTC DiscussionsRegister now to ask a question (free)2005 Dodge Durango multiple codes set for tranny P0700, P0845, P0731, P0732, P0733I have a 2005 Dodge Durango SXT 4.7L with the 5-45RFE transmission.

        "original_context": "### OBD-II Trouble Code Technical Description\nArticle byDon BowmanASE Certified Automotive Tech\nSystem Too Lean at Idle (Bank 1)\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model. We have seen this code on Hyundai, Dodge, and other models.\nThis is an ambiguous code in of itself. It can be a tough code to crack without a diagnostic strategy. During the last two starts, the engine management computer has recognized a problem with the fuel mixture at an idle.\nIt appears that the fuel mixture is too lean (too much air and not enough fuel) at an idle. If you have a 4 cylinder engine the \"Bank 1\" is meaningless, however, if you have a 6 or 8 cylinder engine, Bank 1 will be on the side with the number one cylinder. CodeP2189is the same code but for Bank #2.There is a laundry list of components that could cause this scenario. For the most part the diagnostic procedure is not difficult -- just time consuming, unless it is one of the first items checked. The strategy dictates that the driveability problems are observed and noted, then start with the most commonly found problems and progress from there.SymptomsWith the wide range of possibilities, the problems listed may and may not be present. But, here is where it is important to pay particular attention to the symptoms observed and make a note as to what and when symptoms appear for diagnostic strategy.Vehicle has a miss at an idleHard to start, especially when hotVery irregular idleAdditional codes to pinpoint cause of original P2187 codeWhistling noisesLower turbo boost numbersFuel smellPotential Causes of P2187 DTCFaulty O2 sensor (front)Faulty gas cap sealLeaky or loose oil filler capAir leaking into the intake manifold downstream from the Mass Airflow sensor due to the manifold itself, vacuum hoses off or cracked, leak MAP sensor, Leak at turbo bypass or it's stuck open, power brake booster hose, or a leak in the EVAP system hoses.Faulty MAP sensorEVAP canister purge valveFuel injector leakFuel pressure regulator faultyLeaks in the exhaust systemFaulty variable camshaft timingFaulty ECM (engine management computer)Faulty O2 preheater (front)Clogged fuel filterFuel pump wearing out and producing low pressure.Faulty mass air flow sensorDiagnostic / Repair StepsYour strategy for locating this problem begins with a test drive and observation of any symptoms. The next step is to use a code scanner (available at any auto parts store) and pulling any additional codes.The computer has set a code P2187 stating that the fuel mixture is lean at an idle. This is the main code, however, any component malfunctioning within this loop that has the potential to cause a lean mixture will also be set in code.If the test drive doesn't produce any symptoms it is possible that it is not a real code. In other words, the fuel mixture is not lean and that the computer or oxygen sensor is responsible for setting the code.Every vehicle has a minimum of two oxygen sensors -- one in front of the catalytic converter and one after the converter. These sensors signal the amount of free oxygen left in the exhaust after ignition, which determines the fuel ratio. The front sensor is primarily responsible for the mixture, the second sensor behind the exhaust is used for comparison to the front sensor to determine if the converter is working properly.If a rough idle is present or one of the other symptoms, begin the process with the most likely cause first. Either unmetered air is entering the intake manifold or there is a lack of fuel pressure:Check the fuel cap for cracks and sealing and functionLift the hood and make sure the oil filler cap is tightIf additional codes were present begin with inspecting them firstLook for air leaks starting at the mass airflow sensor. Check the hose or connection between the sensor and the intake manifold all the way to the manifold for cracks or loose connections. Check all vacuum hoses carefully attached to the intake manifold, to include the one to the vacuum brake booster. Check the hose to the MAP sensor and all hoses to the turbo if so equipped.With the engine running, using a can of carburetor cleaner and spray a small mist around the base of the intake manifold and where the two halves meet if it is a two piece. Spray around the base of the EGR for leaks into the manifold. The rpm will increase if a leak is located.Check the PCV valve and hose for leaks.Inspect the fuel injectors for external fuel leaksInspect the fuel pressure regulator by pulling off the vacuum hose and shaking it to see if fuel is present. If so replace it.Shut the engine down and install a fuel pressure tester on the schrader valve on the fuel supply rail to the injectors. Start the engine and note the fuel pressure at an idle and once again at 2500 rpm. Compare these fig",
