    "original_context": "### Technical Description\nMass Air Flow (MAF) Circuit Range/Performance\n\n### What does that mean?\nThis diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (Nissan, Chevrolet, GMC, Mercedes, VW, Toyota, Mazda, BMW, Ford, Audi, Honda, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.\nThe MAF (mass air flow) sensor is a sensor mounted in a vehicle's engine air intake tract downstream from the air filter, and is used to measure the volume and density of air being drawn into the engine. The MAF sensor itself only measures a  portion of the air entering and that value is used to calculate the total volume and density of air being ingested.\nThe powertrain control module (PCM) uses that reading along with other sensor parameters to ensure proper fuel delivery at any given time for optimum power and fuel efficiency.\nBasically this P0101 diagnostic trouble code (DTC) means that there is a problem with the Mass Air Flow (MAF)\n  sensor or circuit. The PCM detects that the actual MAF sensor frequency signal\n  is not within a predetermined expected range of the calculated MAF value.\nNote: Some MAF sensors also incorporate an air temperature sensor, which is another value used by the PCM for optimal engine operation.\nClosely related MAF circuit trouble codes include:\nP0100Mass or Volume Air Flow \"A\" Circuit MalfunctionP0102Mass \n    or Volume Air Flow \"A\" Circuit Low InputP0103Mass \n    or Volume Air Flow \"A\" Circuit High InputP0104Mass or Volume Air Flow \"A\" Circuit Intermittent\nPhoto of a MAF sensor:\n\n### Symptoms\nSymptoms of a P0101 code may include:\nMalfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illumination (a.k.a. check engine light)Rough running engineBlack smoke from tail pipeStallingEngine hard start or stalling after it startsPossible other driveability symptoms\n\n### Possible Causes\nPotential causes for this trouble code may include:\nDirty or contaminated mass air flow sensorFailed MAF sensorIntake air leaksMAF sensor electrical harness or wiring problem (open, shorted, frayed, poor connection, etc.)Clogged catalytic converter on some models (GMC/Chevrolet mainly)\nNote that other codes may be present if you have a P0101. You may have misfire codes or O2 sensor codes, so it's important to take a \"big picture\" look at how the systems work together and effect each other when doing a diagnosis.\n\n### Diagnostic Steps & Possible Solutions\nPossible diagnostic and repair steps include:\nVisually inspect all MAF sensor wiring and connectors to make sure they are intact, not frayed, broken, routed too close to ignition wires/coils, relays, motors, etc.Visually inspect for any obvious air leaks in the air intake systemVisually *closely* inspect the MAF sensor wires or film to see if you can see contamination such as dirt, dust, oil, etc.If the air filter is dirty, replace itCarefully clean the MAF usingMAF cleaner sprayis generally a good DIY friendly diagnostic/repair stepIf the air intake system has a mesh in it, make sure that is also clean (VWs mainly)Loss of vacuum to the MAP sensor can trigger this DTCA low minimum air rate through the sensor bore may cause this DTC to set\n      at idle or during deceleration. Inspect for any vacuum leaks downstream\n  of the MAF sensor.Use a scan tool to monitor real-time sensor values from the MAF sensor, O2 sensors, etc.Check for Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) for your particular make/model in case of known issues on your vehicleThe barometric pressure (BARO) that is used in order to calculate the predicted \n    MAF value is initially based on theMAP sensorat key ON.A high resistance on the ground circuit of theMAP \n    sensorcan cause this DTC to setDo an exhaust backpressure test to determine if the catalytic converter may be clogged\nIf you do need to replace the MAF sensor, we recommend using an original equipment OEM one from the manufacturer rather than buying an aftermarket part.\nNote: The use of a reusable oiled air filter could be a cause of this code, if it is over-oiled. Oil can transfer to the fine wire or film inside the MAF sensor and contaminate it. Use something such asMAF cleaner sprayto clean the MAF in such situations.\n\n### P0101 MAF Sensor Repair Video\nThis video is not produced by us, it is here as an aid in resolving your P0101 trouble code (DTC).\n\n### Related  DTC Discussions\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n2002 silverado 1500 4x4 5.3 l engine codes p0101 p0300i have a 02 chevy silverado 5.3 liter 83000 mile replaced maf sensor o2 sensors before cat still getting p0101 and p0300 codes can anyone help me...2003 silhouette 3.4l P0101 125,000 milesVehicle stalls and is very hard to start.
